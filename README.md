## Scripts for cfRNA Sequencing Data Analysis

This repo contains scripts used in cfRNA-SEEK, a pipeline for identification of cancer relevant features from cfRNA sequencing (cfRNA-seq) data generated by SMART-Total protocol.  Scripts for small cfRNA-seq data processing are also available.

- **SMART-total cfRNA-seq Reads Processing**

To quantify different RNA variations for human genome, as well as the abundance of different microbial taxos, see [analysis-step-smart-total-libraries.md](analysis-step-smart-total-libraries.md).

- **Feature Selection**

To identify cancer relevant features and evaluate the classification performance, see [classification.md](classification.md).

- **Small cfRNA-seq Reads Processing**

To analyze small cfRNA-seq data, see [analysis-step-small-RNA-libraries.md](analysis-step-small-RNA-libraries.md).
