## Scripts for cfRNA Sequencing Data Analysis

- This repo contains scripts used in cfRNA-SEEK, a pipeline for identification of cancer relevant features from cfRNA sequencing data generated by smart-total protocol. The following figure illustrates the overall work flow. Scripts for small RNA sequencing data preprocessing are also available.
