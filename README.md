## Scripts for cfRNA Sequencing Data Analysis

This repo contains scripts used in cfRNA-SEEK, a pipeline for identification of cancer relevant features from cfRNA sequencing (cfRNA-seq) data generated by SMART-Total protocol. The following figure illustrates the overall work flow. Scripts for small cfRNA-seq data preprocessing are also available.

- **SMART-total cfRNA-seq reads preprocessing**

To quantify different RNA variations for human genome, as well as the abundance of different microbial taxos, see [analysis-step-smart-total-libraries.md](analysis-step-smart-total-libraries.md).

- For identification of cancer relevant features, and evaluation of classification performance, see [classification.md](classification.md) `

- For analysis of small RNA libraries, see [analysis-step-small-RNA-libraries.md](analysis-step-small-RNA-libraries.md)
